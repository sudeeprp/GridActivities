# GridActivities
Activities development base: prior to Orchestration

## Getting Started
This project is created to develop individual screens to be integrated with the Activity Orchestrator.
Branches:
* ident_attendance: To develop the Identification and Attendance screens
* curriculum: To develop the curriculum grid and student progress-tracking

### Initial commit
The initial commit was created with the Main activity in Kotlin and the ident_attendance screens in Java. The ident_attendance screens display only the input Json that was sent to them. These activities are to be replaced with the actual activities. Appropriate Json strings need to be returned.
Feel free to alter the MainActivity to suit the test case.

## Constraints
- The application will run only in landscape mode, full-screen.
- Activity lifecycle needs to be handled
- The target Android OS is Nougat
